Pika
====
Pika is a RabbitMQ (AMQP-0-9-1) client library for Python.

Introduction
-------------
Pika is a pure-Python implementation of the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol including RabbitMQ's
extensions.

- Python 2.7 and 3.4+ are supported.

- Since threads aren't appropriate to every situation, it doesn't
  require threads. It takes care not to forbid them, either. The same
  goes for greenlets, callbacks, continuations and generators. It is
  not necessarily thread-safe however, and your mileage will vary.

- People may be using direct sockets, plain old `select()`,
  or any of the wide variety of ways of getting network events to and from a
  python application. Pika tries to stay compatible with all of these, and to
  make adapting it to a new environment as simple as possible.

Documentation
-------------
Pika's documentation can be found at `https://pika.readthedocs.io <https://pika.readthedocs.io>`_

Example
-------
Here is the most simple example of use, sending a message with the BlockingConnection adapter:

.. code :: python

    import pika
    connection = pika.BlockingConnection()
    channel = connection.channel()
    channel.basic_publish(exchange='example',
                          routing_key='test',
                          body=b'Test Message')
    connection.close()

And an example of writing a blocking consumer:

.. code :: python

    import pika
    connection = pika.BlockingConnection()
    channel = connection.channel()

    for method_frame, properties, body in channel.consume('test'):

        # Display the message parts and ack the message
        print(method_frame, properties, body)
        channel.basic_ack(method_frame.delivery_tag)

        # Escape out of the loop after 10 messages
        if method_frame.delivery_tag == 10:
            break

    # Cancel the consumer and return any pending messages
    requeued_messages = channel.cancel()
    print('Requeued %i messages' % requeued_messages)
    connection.close()

Multiple Connection Parameters
------------------------------
You can also pass multiple connection parameter instances for
fault-tolerance as in the code snippet below (host names are just examples, of
course). To enable retries, set `connection_attempts` and `retry_delay` as
needed in the last `pika.ConnectionParameters` element of the sequence. Retries
occur after connection attempts using all of the given connection parameters
fail.

.. code :: python

    import pika
    configs = (
        pika.ConnectionParameters(host='rabbitmq.zone1.yourdomain.com'),
        pika.ConnectionParameters(host='rabbitmq.zone2.yourdomain.com',
                                  connection_attempts=5, retry_delay=1))
    connection = pika.BlockingConnection(configs)

With non-blocking adapters, you can request a connection using multiple
connection parameter instances via the connection adapter's
`create_connection()` class method.

Pika provides the following adapters
------------------------------------

- AsyncioConnection  - adapter for the Python3 AsyncIO event loop
- BlockingConnection - enables blocking, synchronous operation on top of library for simple usage
- SelectConnection   - fast asynchronous adapter without 3rd-party dependencies
- TornadoConnection  - adapter for use with the Tornado IO Loop http://tornadoweb.org
- TwistedConnection  - adapter for use with the Twisted asynchronous package http://twistedmatrix.com/

Connection recovery
-------------------

Some RabbitMQ clients use automated connection recovery mechanisms to
reconnect and recover channels and consumers in case of network errors.

Different types of connection adapters alow you to set up different approaches
to connection recovery.

For BlockingConnection adapter exception handling can be used to check for
connection errors. Simplified example:

.. code :: python

    import pika
    while(True):
        try:
            connection = pika.BlockingConnection(parameters)
            channel = connection.channel()
            channel.basic_consume('standard', on_message_callback)
            channel.start_consuming()
        # Do not recover if connection was closed by broker
        except pika.exceptions.ConnectionClosedByBroker:
            break
        # Do not recover on channel errors
        except pika.exceptions.AMQPChannelError:
            break
        # Recover on all other connection errors
        except pika.exceptions.AMQPConnectionError:
            continue

This example can be found in `examples/consume_recover.py`.

You can also use decorators like `retry <https://github.com/invl/retry>`_
to set up recovery behaviour:

.. code :: python

    from retry import retry
    @retry(pika.exceptions.AMQPConnectionError, delay=5, jitter=(1, 3))
    def consume():
        connection = pika.BlockingConnection(parameters)
        channel = connection.channel()
        channel.basic_consume('standard', on_message_callback)
        try:
            channel.start_consuming()
        # Do not recover connections closed by server
        except pika.exceptions.ConnectionClosedByBroker:
            pass
    consume()

These decorators allow you to configure some additional recovery behaviours,
like delays and attempts count.

This example can be found in `examples/consume_recover_retry.py`.

For asynchronous adapters you can use `on_close_callback` for connection.
This callback can be used to clean up and recover the connection.

An example of recovery using `on_close_callback` can be found
in `examples/asynchronous_consumer_example.py`

Contributing
------------
To contribute to pika, please make sure that any new features or changes
to existing functionality **include test coverage**.

*Pull requests that add or change code without coverage will be rejected.*

Additionally, please format your code using `yapf <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/yapf>`_
with ``google`` style prior to issuing your pull request.

Extending to support additional I/O frameworks
----------------------------------------------
New non-blocking adapters may be implemented in either of the following ways:
- By subclassing :py:class:`pika.adapters.base_connection.BaseConnection` and
  implementing its abstract method(s) and passing BaseConnection's constructor
  an implementation of
  :py.class:`pika.adapters.utils.nbio_interface.AbstractIOServices`. For
  examples, refer to the implementations of
  :py:class:`pika.AsyncioConnection` and :py:class:`pika.TornadoConnection`.
- By subclassing :py:class:`pika.connection.connection.Connection` and
  implementing its abstract method(s). For an example, refer to the
  implementation of
  :py:class:`pika.adapters.twisted_connection.TwistedProtocolConnection`.
