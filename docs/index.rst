Introduction to Pika
====================

Pika is a pure-Python implementation of the AMQP 0-9-1 protocol that tries to stay fairly independent of the underlying network support library.

This documentation is a combination of both user documentation and module development documentation. Modules and classes called out in the Using Pika section below will cover a majority of what users who are implementation pika in their applications will need. The Pika Core Objects section below lists all of the modules that are internal to Pika.

If you have not developed with Pika or RabbitMQ before, the :doc:`connecting` documentation is a good place to get started.

Installing Pika
---------------

Pika is available for download via PyPI and may be installed using easy_install or pip::

    pip install pika

or::

    easy_install pika

To install from source, run "python setup.py install" in the root source directory.

Using Pika
----------
Pika supports two modes of development, synchronous using the BlockingConnection adapter and asynchronous using one of the AsyncoreConnection, SelectConnection and TornadoConnection adapters.

-------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Fix timeout in twisted adapter (Submitted by cellscape)
- Fix blocking_connection poll timer resolution to milliseconds (Submitted by cellscape)
- Fix channel._on_close() without a method frame (Submitted by Richard Boulton)
- Addressed exception on close (Issue #279 - fix by patcpsc)
- 'messages' not initialized in BlockingConnection.cancel() (Issue #289 - fix by Mik Kocikowski)
- Make queue_unbind behave like queue_bind (Issue #277)
- Address closing behavioral issues for connections and channels (Issues #275,
- Pass a Method frame to Channel._on_close in Connection._on_disconnect (Submitted by wulczer)
- Fix channel closed callback signature in the Twisted adapter (Submitted by wulczer)
- Don't stop the IOLoop on connection close for in the Twisted adapter (Submitted by wulczer)
- Update the asynchronous examples to fix reconnecting and have it work
- Warn if the socket was closed such as if RabbitMQ dies without a Close frame
- Fix URLParameters ssl_options (Issue #296)

** Behavioral changes **

- Change core connection communication behavior to prefer outbound writes over reads, addressing a recursion issue
- Update connection on close callbacks, changing callback method signature
- Update channel on close callbacks, changing callback method signature
- Give more info in the ChannelClosed exception
- Change the constructor signature for BlockingConnection, block open/close callbacks
- Disable the use of add_on_open_callback/add_on_close_callback methods in BlockingConnection
