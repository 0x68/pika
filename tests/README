Tests are written for nose:

Tests are expecting a RabbitMQ instance local to the machine where you are
running the tests from.

In the tests directory, simply run:

nosetests

adapter_tests.py should fail on your platform based upon the following conditions:

If you are running on a Linux box, expect the KQueuePoller test to fail.
If you are running on an OSX box, expect the PollPoller and EPollPoller to fail.
If you are running in Windows, KQueuePoller, PollPoller, and EPollPoller should fail.
